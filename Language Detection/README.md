1. First we imported the langdetect package
2. Next we created a function which takes the sentence as an argument and detects the language of the sentence using detect() function of langdetect package.
3. Later we created aa dictionary which consists of langauges and their respective codes to make sure the output looks good as the detect() function is going to 
   return the lang codes.
